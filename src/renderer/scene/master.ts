// src/renderer/scene/master.ts
//
// "Master" = the user's loaded STL, displayed in the viewport as the object
// the mold will be built around. This module owns the Three.js side of that
// object: converting an ArrayBuffer into a `THREE.Mesh` with a matte material,
// tagging it per the `three-js-viewer` skill, and swapping it into the scene
// under the pre-existing `userData.tag === 'master'` group.
//
// Kernel integration (post-CSP-widen):
//   The locked renderer CSP now includes `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` (see
//   `src/renderer/index.html` and `.claude/skills/desktop-app-shell/SKILL.md`),
//   which permits `manifold-3d`'s WASM kernel to instantiate in the renderer.
//   Per ADR-002 the kernel is the single source of truth for geometry:
//   - `loadStl(buffer)` parses the STL and returns `{ geometry, manifold }`
//     with an automatic repair pass (silent repair is surfaced via a console
//     warning inside `bufferGeometryToManifold`).
//   - `meshVolume(manifold)` returns the watertight volume in mm³, matching
//     the manifold-3d `volume()` API — deterministic cross-platform.
//   - The display mesh's `BufferGeometry` is derived from the repaired
//     manifold via `manifoldToBufferGeometry`, so the rendered mesh is
//     guaranteed to match what downstream booleans / offsets will consume.
//
// Manifold lifetime (Phase 3c, issue #37 — silicone-shell generator):
//   `setMaster` now KEEPS the Manifold alive past return. It is cached on the
//   Master group's `userData[MASTER_MANIFOLD_KEY]` and lives until the next
//   `setMaster` call (which disposes the previous Manifold before replacing
//   it) or until `disposeMaster(scene)` is invoked during viewport teardown.
//
//   Rationale: the silicone-shell generator (`generateSiliconeShell` in
//   `src/geometry/generateMold.ts`) needs the master Manifold as input, and
//   the generate button is a user-driven action with no strict upper bound
//   on delay after load — re-parsing the STL on every Generate click would
//   needlessly burn 50–500 ms on anything above a trivial mesh. Caching on
//   the Master group keeps ownership colocated with the scene node the
//   Manifold describes, so eviction is trivially hooked into the existing
//   "previous master → swap" lifecycle in this module.
//
//   WASM-memory invariant: at most ONE master Manifold is live at a time.
//   `setMaster` disposes the previous one before installing the new one;
//   `disposeMaster` is idempotent and safe to call on an empty group.
//
// Swap semantics:
//   - At most one master is live at a time. `setMaster` disposes the previous
//     mesh (geometry + material) before adding the new one. The Master GROUP
//     itself is never re-added — we always reuse whatever createScene() put
//     there, so children like lights are unaffected and tags stay stable.
