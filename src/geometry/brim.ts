// Wave F (issue #84). Build a flat brim flange on each cut face of a
// sliced shell piece. The brim is a box-extruded flange sitting FLUSH
// against the cut plane on the piece's side, extending radially outward
// from the shell's outer surface by `brimWidth_mm`, with a small
// `bondOverlap` inward into the shell wall for mechanical bonding.
// Vertically it spans the shell's Y range minus a 2 mm margin top +
// bottom so it never pokes out the open pour edge or the base-slab
// interlock.
//
// Issue #89 fix (post-dogfood on main 2026-04-22)
// -----------------------------------------------
//
// Pre-#89 the brim box spanned the FULL radial extent from `xzCenter`
// to `outerRadius + brimWidth + slop`, i.e. it extended all the way
// through the silicone cavity to the Y-axis. Two consequences were
// visible in the viewer:
//
//   1. Adjacent brims OVERLAPPED at the Y-axis centerline (all N cut
//      planes meet there) — brim-on-brim intersection in a thin column.
//   2. Brim's inner portion sat INSIDE the shell's outer surface →
//      intruded into the silicone cavity.
//
// The fix, applied in two complementary changes:
//
//   (A) NARROW the brim box radially. Its radial span is now
//       `bondOverlap + brimWidth` — typically 8+10 = 18 mm (vs ~50 mm
//       pre-fix on a mini-figurine). Its inner edge sits at
//       `outerRadius − bondOverlap`, outer edge at
//       `outerRadius + brimWidth`. Far enough from the Y-axis that
//       adjacent brims never touch.
//   (B) SUBTRACT `siliconeOuter` from the brim box before unioning.
//       `siliconeOuter` is the outset of the master by
//       `siliconeThickness` — a SOLID Manifold filling everything from
//       the master's surface outward by the silicone layer, i.e. the
//       shell's inner cavity volume. Subtracting it carves away any
//       brim material that would poke into the silicone cavity, even
//       on non-convex masters where the radial narrowing alone isn't
//       enough to clear the cavity.
//
// After (A) + (B), the brim:
//   - Starts at the shell's outer surface (with a `bondOverlap ≡
//     printShellThickness` inward overlap for mechanical bonding).
//   - Extends outward by `brimWidth`.
//   - Never crosses into the silicone cavity.
//   - Never reaches the Y-axis (so adjacent brims never intersect).
//
// Construction sequence (post-#89):
//
//   1. Build an axis-aligned box of size
//        `(bondOverlap + brimWidth) × ySize × brimThickness`
//      centered at origin.
//   2. Pre-translate the box in its LOCAL frame so its center sits at
//        `( (outerRadius + brimWidth/2 − bondOverlap/2), yCenter,
//          ±brimThickness/2 )`
//      — the local-X offset places the inner edge at radial distance
//      `outerRadius − bondOverlap` and the outer edge at
//      `outerRadius + brimWidth`; `±brimThickness/2` along local ±Z
//      keeps the brim FLUSH against the cut plane on the piece's side.
//   3. Rotate `.rotate([0, -θ_deg, 0])` about +Y where θ is the cut-
//      plane's outward-radial angle. Maps local +X → `radial(θ) =
//      (cos θ, 0, sin θ)` and local +Z → `n_CCW(θ) = (-sin θ, 0, cos θ)`
//      (derivation below).
//   4. Translate by `(xzCenter.x, 0, xzCenter.z)` to plant the box's
//      inner pivot at the master's XZ center.
//   5. `Manifold.difference([brimBox, siliconeOuter])` — carves away
//      any material inside the silicone cavity (belt-and-braces for
//      non-convex masters; a no-op on convex ones where step 2's
//      narrow box is already clear of the cavity).
//   6. `Manifold.union(piece, brimCarved)` — the union absorbs the
//      bond-overlap portion with the shell piece and contributes only
//      the radially outward portion as a new flange.
//
// Why `±brimThickness/2`? For the CCW-side cut plane (piece i's LOWER-
// CCW bound at angle a0), the "into piece" direction is `n_CCW(a0)` —
// exactly the local +Z after rotation, so `+brimThickness/2`. For the
// CW-side cut plane (upper-CCW bound at a1), "into piece" is
// `-n_CCW(a1)` — exactly the local -Z after rotation, so
// `-brimThickness/2`. Flipping the local Z offset sign keeps the
// rotation angle consistent with the outward-radial direction on BOTH
// cut planes.
//
// Why `bondOverlap`? Mechanical bond between the brim flange and the
// shell wall: the brim overlaps INWARD by `bondOverlap` mm past the
// shell's outer surface, so after union the two are a single fused
// body rather than two surfaces touching. `bondOverlap` is set to
// `printShellThickness_mm` by the caller (default 8 mm) — the full
// shell thickness. Can't exceed the shell thickness or the brim pokes
// through into the silicone (which is why step 5 then subtracts
// `siliconeOuter`).
//
// sideCount === 2 special case: only ONE cut plane total (angles 90°
// and 270° define the same vertical plane). The caller (via
// `generateMold.ts`) passes a single cut angle for each piece; the brim
// builder treats it as a single-brim piece.
//
// Rotation-angle derivation
// -------------------------
//
// Manifold's `.rotate([0, φ_deg, 0])` applies the standard right-handed
// Y rotation:
//
//     (x, z) → (x cos φ + z sin φ, -x sin φ + z cos φ)
//
// Applied to local +X = (1, 0, 0): → (cos φ, 0, -sin φ). We want this
// to equal `radial(θ) = (cos θ, 0, sin θ)`, so φ = -θ. Applied to local
// +Z = (0, 0, 1) with φ = -θ: → (sin(-θ), 0, cos(-θ)) = (-sin θ,
// 0, cos θ) = `n_CCW(θ)`. ✓
//
// Ownership contract:
//
//   - Input `piece` Manifold is consumed by the union → the caller
//     receives a FRESH Manifold and must `.delete()` it. The input
//     `piece` is `.delete()`-ed internally.
//   - Input `siliconeOuter` is CALLER-OWNED; addBrim does NOT delete
//     it. Caller retains responsibility for the full lifetime —
//     defer the `siliconeOuter.delete()` in `generateMold.ts` until
//     AFTER every `addBrim` call for every piece completes.
//   - Every intermediate Manifold is `.delete()`-ed in a `finally`
//     block so no leak happens on any failure path.
